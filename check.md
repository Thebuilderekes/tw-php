# PHP secutiry tips

## Always validate and sanitize user input:
This is one of the most important things you can do to prevent security vulnerabilities. Validate user input to ensure it is in the expected format and does not contain malicious code. Sanitize user input to remove any potentially harmful characters.

## Use prepared statements:
Prepared statements help to prevent SQL injection attacks by separating the SQL query from the user input.
Escape output: When outputting data to the browser, escape any special characters to prevent them from being interpreted as code.

## Keep your PHP code up to date:
This is important to ensure that you are not using any libraries or frameworks that contain known vulnerabilities.

## Use a security scanner: 
There are a number of security scanners available that can help you to identify potential vulnerabilities in your PHP code.
